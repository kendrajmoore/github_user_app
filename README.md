## About the Project 

The Github Command Line App is an open-source project built for coders wanting to explore and discover new Github repos straight from their terminal. The motive behind the development of this software is to tap into the sea of ever-growing programming languages and bridging the gap between developers and code. This project aims to familiarize coders with an array of programming languages, subsequently enriching their skills and comprehension.

Build in Rust, the Github Command Line App lets you navigate through the world of Github repositories efficiently and effectively. With a command-line interface that is both user-friendly and resilient, this app takes you on a journey to learn, interpret, and apply new programming languages, leading to an upsurge in your coding arsenal while providing opportunities to learn and grow.
